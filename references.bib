               Blackbirds (Turdus merula) during the breeding season",
  author    = "Post, P and Gotmark, F",
  abstract  = "In many birds, breeding males display bright colors, sing, and
               engage in active territory defense; whereas females are less
               conspicuous. Therefore, it is sometimes assumed that in the
               breeding season males suffer higher predation than females.
               Several Studies have reported, however, higher female predation
               rates, which suggests that traits other than coloration and
               mate-acquisition behaviors are important in determining
               predation rates for the sexes. Theoretical and empirical work
               suggests that foraging behavior and foraging rate are major
               determinants of predation risk. Here, we examine this
               possibility in a study of breeding Eurasian Blackbirds (Turdus
               merula) and predation on them by Eurasian Sparrowhawks
               (Accipiter nisus). Female Eurasian Blackbirds foraged more than
               males and foraged closer to the ground, both early and late in
               the breeding season. On the basis of this observation, we
               predicted that females should suffer higher predation than
               males. Of 98 Eurasian Blackbirds taken in 33 Eurasian
               Sparrowhawk territories during four years, 56 were females and
               42 males. On the basis of the male-biased sex ratio in the
               Population, female Eurasian Blackbirds suffered higher predation
               risk than males. For breeding birds, these results indicate a
               trade-off between foraging effort and predation rate, which is
               of importance for sexual dichromatism (selection for female
               crypsis), population sex ratio, and behaviors of the sexes.",

  abstract  = "In contrast to the thoroughly studied incubation and nestling
               periods, the postfledging period of the Common Cuckoo (Cuculus
               canorus) remains virtually unknown. Here, we report detailed
               observations of a cuckoo fledgling attended by a male Chaffinch
               (Fringilla coelebs). Molecular data (nuclear DNA) showed the
               fledgling was a male belonging to the Cuculus c. canorus/C.
               saturatus clade while mitochondrial DNA data confirmed that it
               did not belong to blue egg gens that parasitizes Redstarts
               (Phoenicurus phoenicurus), which is the most common local host
               and the only regular Common Cuckoo host. During one week of
               observations, feeding rates did not change, body mass decreased
               (by 10\%), and wing length increased (by 16\%). Video recordings
               showed that the provided diet consisted mostly of larvae and
               that the fledgling also self-fed on lichens. A radio transmitter
               fitted on the fledgling revealed that daily movement distances
               ranged from 0 to 650 m and significantly increased with age. We
               suggest that future studies should focus on the postfledging
               period in brood parasite young because this stage currently
               represents a major gap in our understanding of parasite-host
               arms races. Received 22 December 2016. Accepted 15 April 2017.",
